# Conversational Bots with Sentiment Analysis

## Project overview
This project aims to create two bots that converse with each other, with responses influenced by sentiment analysis. The bots are trained on the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains labeled data of tweets with sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral.

The goal is to generate a conversation where the bots react to each other's emotions based on the sentiment of the text. This can lead to a more realistic and engaging interaction, as each bot is influenced by the tone of the other's responses.


## Datasets to train the model
The Sentiment140 (From Twitter) dataset is used for training the bots. It consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled with sentiment values:

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
